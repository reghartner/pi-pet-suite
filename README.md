# Harley's Treat Dispenser
Spring Boot application with a (super) simple UI designed for a Raspberry Pi controlled Treat Dispenser.

[See it in action!](https://youtu.be/VM61f9kIBaY)

API allows for:
* Taking a picture via the pi camera
* Dispensing treats via a GPIO controlled motor
* Triggering treats after some period of silence detected by a connected microphone

Total ~$100, or ~$55 if you have a raspberry pi lying around

# Running the App
I would only expect this to startup if running on a pi, otherwise the GPIO pin initialization will probably fail.

Install Java 11 SDK

`mvn spring-boot:run` and off she goes!

# Scripts
Also included are some python scripts which are capable of most of the same functions as this application, but can be run on demand without a service.  You will probably have to resole a bunch of dependencies to get them to work...
* python3
* pyaudio
* picamera
* RPi.GPIO 

# Building the Treat Dispenser
I am a hardware noob, so I'm sure some folks will come up with way better construction methods... 

* Saw off the shaft of the treat dispenser knob (knob in the trash)
* Attach to the motor with the shaft coupling
* Connect the mic and camera which just pop in
* Connect the motor to the driver and the driver to the pi GPIO pins
  * Use pins 7, 11, 13, and 15 (what the pi calls them)
  * In the code, these map to GPIO pins 0, 7, 2, and 3 respectively
  * If this is confusing, which it is, consult this diagram: [Pi Pin Layouts](https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-3b-rev1.html)
* Figure out how to mount the motor...I ended up fastening 2 outward facing bolts onto the dispenser which allows for easy removal/replacement
